# Awesome-javaScript-Quiz
I will be building a fun and interactive quiz about car facts to determine if you are a real car person.
You should be able to start the game, and answer 10 questions with 60 seconds on the clock. If you get 
a wrong question 10 seconds will be deducted on the clock, however if you get a correct answer the 
clock will reset to 60 seconds. At the end of the game a user should be able to save their score with 
their initials.
